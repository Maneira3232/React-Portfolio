      Hi! I'm Joseph D. Maneira but I go by Joe. I came from a construction management background and it allowed me to use my creativity,but at some point I started feeling like it was so limiting creatively.Then I saw what you could do as a web developer, the unlimited creativity was alluring and I wanted to do what ever it took to get my foot into the industry so I decided to Sign up for the Rutgers
                Bootcamp.
